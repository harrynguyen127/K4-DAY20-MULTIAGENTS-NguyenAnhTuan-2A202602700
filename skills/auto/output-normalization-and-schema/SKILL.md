name: output-normalization-and-schema
description: Use for data transformation, log parsing, or reporting tasks that define explicit output rules for names, ordering, filtering, or schema.
---
- Before coding, write down every explicit output rule as a checklist.
- Normalize identifiers exactly as specified: lower/upper case, separators, canonical labels.
- Remove or filter records according to the stated criteria; verify nothing forbidden remains.
- Sort using all required keys and directions, including stable tie-breakers.
- Add required schema or metadata fields in the correct object and with the correct names.
- Keep field names, nesting, and types consistent with the specification.
- Test edge cases for normalization, sorting, missing values, and duplicate handling.
- Run a small validation script against the output for each rule.
- If validation output is empty or swallowed, rerun through a file or simpler command.
- Cross-check totals and sample records against the raw input before finalizing.
- Only after every rule passes, provide the final answer.
