description: Use when fixing bugs or changing code in an existing repository that has style, test, changelog, or type-annotation rules.
---
- Read the task and repository conventions before editing.
- Treat original test files as read-only; never edit them unless explicitly told.
- If new test files are allowed, add regression tests for each bug fixed.
- Keep tests focused on the reported behavior; do not weaken or delete existing assertions.
- Update the changelog for every fix using the exact required heading and entry format.
- Add type annotations to all public functions and methods: every parameter and return value.
- If a type-check or lint rule is stated, run the relevant checker after editing.
- Run the full test suite plus any new regression tests before declaring success.
- Verify required auxiliary files exist and match the requested names, locations, and structure.
- Re-read the task checklist and confirm each non-code deliverable was produced.
